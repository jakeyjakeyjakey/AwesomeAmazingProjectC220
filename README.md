# AwesomeAmazingProjectC220
One awesome amazing project for MSCH-C220 Game Jam, November 2022

## Theme
We took the "Time for Dinner" theme literally but wanted to put a twist on your average Thanksgiving dinner.

## Game Play
Interactive fiction game- click through with what food items you want.. but beware something might still be alive.

## Impediments
We had some issues utilizing the github collab feature with committing branches and getting certain files to appear for everyone.

## Implementation
- Procreate used for background images

## References

## Future Development
Add more juicy features like sounds when pressing buttons.
